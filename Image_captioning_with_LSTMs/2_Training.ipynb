    "\n",

    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** CNN-RNN Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "CNN Encoder: The encoder is based on a pre-trained ResNet-18 model. The fully connected (FC) layer of the ResNet model is replaced with a linear embedding layer that reduces the high-dimensional feature vector from the ResNet output to the specified embed_size.\n",
    "RNN Decoder: The decoder is an LSTM network. It takes the image feature embedding from the CNN as input and generates captions sequentially. The RNN has the following components:\n",
    "An embedding layer that converts words into vector representations.\n",
    "An LSTM with a hidden size of hidden_size and a configurable number of layers.\n",
    "A fully connected (FC) layer that maps the LSTM hidden states to a vocabulary-size output for predicting the next word in the caption.\n",
    "Selection of Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch size: Typically, values like 32 or 64 are used for efficient training on GPUs. I selected a batch size of 64, balancing memory usage and training speed.\n",
    "Vocab threshold: A threshold of 5 was chosen to ensure that only words appearing frequently in the dataset are included in the vocabulary. This reduces noise from rare words and keeps the vocabulary size manageable.\n",
    "Vocab from file: False, since I’m creating a new vocabulary based on the dataset.\n",
    "Embed size: I set embed_size=256, which is a common choice in image captioning models. This size is a trade-off between expressive power and computational efficiency.\n",
    "Hidden size: hidden_size=512 is a standard choice for the LSTM hidden state size, providing enough capacity for the model to learn meaningful patterns from the captions.\n",
    "Number of epochs: I selected num_epochs=3 for initial training, which should be sufficient to observe learning behavior before deciding whether to continue for longer.\n",
    "Save and print frequencies: I set save_every=1 and print_every=100 to ensure regular progress tracking without overwhelming the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I left the transform at its provided value. The default transform_train includes resizing, cropping, and normalization, which are crucial for a CNN. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resizing: Resizing the images to a fixed size ensures consistency in input dimensions for the CNN.\n",
    "Random cropping: This adds some variability and acts as a form of data augmentation, which helps prevent overfitting.\n",
    "Normalization: Since a pre-trained ResNet is being used, it's important to normalize the images with the same mean and standard deviation as the original dataset (ImageNet).\n",
    "These operations make the images compatible with the pre-trained ResNet and provide useful augmentation for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I selected the parameters as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters())`\n",
    "This choice was made to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Freeze the CNN weights: The CNN encoder is based on a pre-trained ResNet model, so I do not update its weights during training. This reduces the computational burden and training time while leveraging the powerful pre-trained features.\n",
    "Train the embedding and decoder layers: The embedding layer and decoder (LSTM and fully connected layers) are initialized randomly and need to be learned from scratch to map the image features and captions.\n",
    "This choice ensures that only the newly introduced layers are trained, which is sufficient for the captioning task without requiring the fine-tuning of the entire ResNet model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I selected the Adam optimizer; Adam is well-suited for training deep neural networks because it adapts the learning rate for each parameter individually, making it more robust and faster to converge than traditional optimizers like SGD.\n",
    "Learning rate: A learning rate of 0.001 is a common starting point for Adam. It's high enough to allow quick convergence while avoiding instability during training."

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, if you would like to go above and beyond in this project, you can read about some approaches to minimizing overfitting in section 4.3.1 of [this paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7505636).  In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "## Step 3: (Optional) Validate your Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
